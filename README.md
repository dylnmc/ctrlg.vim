# ctrlg.vim

![animated image showing control g differences][ctrlg_gif]

Use `<c-g>` and `g<c-g>` with a pop of color! Also, use `<c-w><c-g>` in `:terminal`!

`CTRL-G`, `{count} CTRL-G`, `g_CTRL-G`, `v_g_CTRL-G`, and `t_CTRL-W_CTRL-G` are all supported and respect `'shortmess'`.

*Note: these plugins blatantly overwrite all of the maps and don't use `<plug>`s. If you want this to change, open an issue.*
